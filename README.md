# GKmeans

A graph-based k-means algorithm for clustering high dimensional data

Clustering high-dimensional data remains a fundamental yet challenging task in unsupervised learning, where the effectiveness of classical algorithms like k-means is hindered by the curse of dimensionality and their reliance on Euclidean distances. In this work, we introduce GK-means, a novel graph-based extension of the k-means algorithm that leverages geodesic distances computed over a k-nearest neighbors graph (k-NNG) to better reflect the intrinsic geometry of data manifolds. By replacing Euclidean distances with geodesic distances obtained via Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the proposed method can detect clusters of arbitrary shapes and densities, offering improved robustness to noise and high-dimensional sparsity. Unlike many state-of-the-art clustering approaches, our algorithm maintains linear complexity in the number of samples and edges, making it scalable to large datasets. Extensive experiments on several real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GK-means outperforms both classical k-means and the non-optimized HDBSCAN algorithm (default hyperparameters) across multiple cluster quality metrics. These results establish GK-means as a powerful and computationally efficient alternative for structure discovery in complex high dimensional data.
